Welcome to the etg internship project using python.
In this project we have created a nested dictionary and added around 30 key-pair values which is stored in a json file called record.json.
Then we are going to add some new products in which the user has to enter the attributes.
The attributes are product id, product name, price, quantity, expiry date and weight of the product.
Then under adding products we need to open the json file which is record.json in write mode and save it in a variable called fd.
And then the file is closed.
After adding the user has entered all the details, the record.json file needs to be updated and then all the products including new ones are printed.
Then we are purchasing the product by enteing details such as product id and product quantity.
The total billing amount and quantities of the purchased products are altered accordingly.
After this the record.json file needs to be updated.
And again the products are printed.
At last we have created a sales.json file in which the total sales are shown.
